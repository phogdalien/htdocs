<h1 id="mobsh">MOBS</h1>

<p>
  Zombie: Zombies are very annoying hostile mobs that will attack you as soon as they see you. It's literally a zombie. if a zombie goes into the sunlight it will die but it will try to have you as it's last lunch so, i'd stay away from them (or at least try to)
</p>
  <p>
 Baby Zombie:they are faster smaller zombies.
 </p>
 <p>
 Creeper: The creeper is very annoying and "creepy". if you hear a hissing sound, run. run as fast as you can and don't look back. These things will blow you up and if they are in groups they will kill you. Just look out for a green mob with no arms and stay away from them and you'll be fine. I'd recommend using a strong material like obsidian for protection around your house. if that's too hard to get then just get a bunch of wood so you can repair your house
 </p>
<p>
 Skeleton: They have bows. they will shoot you in the face. and die if you shoot back.not much to say about them. Just like zombies they will burn in the sun and die.
 </p>
<p>
 Spider: hostile in the night and can climb up walls. if you attack it, it will attack you, if you leave it alone, it will leave you alone, until night comes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Slime: they are just annoying green blobs. If you kill one it will turn into smaller slime, and it will keep descending in size until it is very small but it can still hurt you.
 </p>
 <p>
 Pillager: they are fast villagers with axes and will kill you as they bust through the door saying "HERE'S JOHNNY" (that's a shining reference they won't actually bust down your door)
 </p>
 <p>
 Enderman: if you know scp 096 you would know what not to do to these creatures, if you don't know that then just don't at them straight in the face and you'll be fine
 </p>
 <p>
 Phantom: it's comes out if you don't sleep and will attack you, so i suggest finding a bed quickly and sleeping the next night that comes
 </p>
 <p>
 Drowned: they are zombies that drowned and can swim, some spawn with tridents and can throw the tridents
 </p>
 <p>
 Warden: Don't, just don't go near it. it will kill you in 2 hits even with the strongest armor on.
 </p>
 <p>
 blaze: they shoot fireballs at you
 </p>
 <p>
 Ghast: just like the blaze it shoots fireballs at you but can also fly
 </p>
 <p>
 Wither Skeleton: it's a tall black skeleton that has a sword and can kill you in one hit and 5 seconds
 </p>
 <p>
 Magma Cube: it's the fire version of the slime
 </p>
 <p>
 Zombie pigman: will not attack you unless you attack it. They attack in groups. will also attack you if you take their gold.
